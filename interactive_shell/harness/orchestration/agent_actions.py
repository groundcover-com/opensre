"""Facade for second-phase terminal action handling.

The interactive shell sends free text to the CLI-agent path first. Before the
assistant writes a conversational answer, this facade asks the second-phase
planner whether the user explicitly requested terminal work, then dispatches any
approved actions through the tool registry.

The implementation lives in the ``terminal_actions`` package:

- ``planning`` decides whether there is an executable plan.
- ``execution`` owns the public execution flow and per-turn metrics.
- ``dispatch`` converts planned actions into tool calls.
- ``feedback`` owns user-visible denial/error output.

Keep this file as the stable import surface for runtime and tests.
