"""Shared UI theme constants (color hex codes).

Lives at the top of ``app/`` rather than under ``cli/`` because
core modules (e.g. ``core/orchestration/node/publish_findings/renderers/
terminal.py``) need the same color values without depending on the
CLI layer. The CLI's theme module re-exports these so existing
``from platform.terminal.theme import BRAND, …`` imports
keep working — the hex values stay in one place.
