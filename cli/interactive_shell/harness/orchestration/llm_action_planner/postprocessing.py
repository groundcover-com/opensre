"""Finalization for planner action results.

The LLM action planner is the sole tool selector: there is no regex-based
intent inference and no deterministic post-hoc rewriting of the model's chosen
actions. This module therefore only wraps the parsed plan in a stable result
type; it does not second-guess the planner.
